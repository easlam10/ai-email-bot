Auditor reported 90 students that are unpaid on Erp . As shown in above shaded area of this file. After rechecking it we found many mistakes done by the auditor that shows unprofessionalism by auditor during audit of our campus. I found that 66/90 students are fully paid on Erp according to given report but the auditor mention them without checking. And 24/90 are half fee paid on Erp ( means if they have to pay for two-month one month fee is entered on Erp and other is not entered just because of Erp issue not because of any personal cause)and half not paid . And these cases and amount are shown in above excel sheet according to audit report. This audit report damaged our institutional as well as personal reputation in front of higher officials. Kindly ask the auditor why he did do like this. Kindly reply us. After rechecking of report we find that the missing amount not entered on Erp because of technical Erp issue ( pay two month fee but Erp do not show the last month fee if remain unpaid) we have to pay (178070) total amount .Report is rechecked and reorganized by M Muneeb khan info & admin officer kips jampur.Evidence of paid fee is attached in picture form in front of all students from Erp. And remarks is also written in the end.RegardsHafiz Muhammad Waqas BhattiProject HeadKips Preparation Jampur Campus."
